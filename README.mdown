Changing AppModel and database config to let CakePHP work with Master/Slave database setup.
Overriding several CakePHP functions and add random slave initiation.

##Usage
Add these methods to your APP/app_model.php or use this file as your app_model
If you have model specific callbacks use parent::beforeSave() before anything else in that method.

	class PostModel extends AppModel 
	{
		public funtion beforeSave($options=array())
		{
			// Always call AppModel beforeSave() !!
			$ret = parent::beforeSave($options);
			
			// model specific tasks
			
			return $ret;
		}
	}
